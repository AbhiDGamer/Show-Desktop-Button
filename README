This is my first write up/modification of a Gnome Shell Extension, which has mainly been tested for 3.2 but should work with any version that MGSE Window List works with.

The idea of this was taken from the MGSE Window List as a proof of concept, and for the fun of learning how js works with Gnome Shell, it has been a great learning curve already.

### Description: 

Places a button to the left of the Window List to hide all windows and show the current desktop, credit to Linux Mint, forked from MGSE Window List.

Version 4: 
Updated to work with Favorites menu
Fixed icon size
Also hides the Activities overview. 
Placement options are available by editing the extension.js.

'nano ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/show-desktop@l300lvl.tk/extension.js'
