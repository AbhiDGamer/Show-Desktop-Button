This is my first write up/modification of a Gnome Shell Extension, which has mainly been tested for 3.2 but should work with any version that MGSE Window List works with.

The idea of this was taken from the MGSE Window List as a proof of concept, and for the fun of learning how js works with Gnome Shell, it has been a great learning curve already.

Description: Places a button to the left of the Window List to hide all windows and show the current desktop, this is a split-off of the MGSE Window List, most code credit goes to Linux Mint and MGSE devs

TODO for version 4: Add placement options.
